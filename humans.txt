    Pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms behind the couch stare out the window, sit on human and poop in litter box, scratch the walls. Walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield kick up litter, lick butt, use lap as chair, so catch mouse and gave it as a present and kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff meowzer!.
